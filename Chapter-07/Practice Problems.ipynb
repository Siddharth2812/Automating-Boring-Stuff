    "  # Practice Questions\n",
    "1. What is the function that creates Regex objects?\n",
    "> re.compile()\n",
    "2. Why are raw strings often used when creating Regex objects?\n",
    "> So that the backslash(\\) wont be considered as a escape character\n",
    "3. What does the search() method return?\n",
    "> Looks for the pattern given in the regex object and returns the value matching the pattern.\n",
    "4. How do you get the actual strings that match the pattern from a Match object?\n",
    "> variable.group()\n",
    "5. In the regex created from r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group 0 cover? Group 1? Group 2?\n",
    "> Group-0 : Entire group of the string that matched the given pattern.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "> Group-1 : The 1st set of pattern i.e. (\\d\\d\\d)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "> Group-2 : The second set of pattern i.e. (\\d\\d\\d - \\d\\d\\d\\d)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Parentheses and periods have specific meanings in regular expression syntax. How would you specify that you want a regex to match actual parentheses and period characters?\n",
    "> By adding a backslash(\\\\) before it like \\\\. and \\\\( & \\\\)\n",
    "7. The findall() method returns a list of strings or a list of tuples of strings. What makes it return one or the other?\n",
    "> findall() method returns a list of strings if the given regular expression doesnt consist of groups. If groups are present in the given regualr expresssion findall() method returns a list of tuples to represent each tuple and what group it belongs to in the regex\n",
    "8. What does the | character signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "> It is called a pipe and used as or statement (optional matching)\n",
    "9. What two things does the ? character signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "> We can use it to match either both the groups or only the other part of group.\n",
    "10. What is the difference between the + and * characters in regular expressions?\n",
    "> \\+ is used to match one or more repetetions (It requires atleast one repetetion)\n",
    "> \\* is used to match zero or more repetetions\n",
    "11. What is the difference between {3} and {3,5} in regular expressions?\n",
    "> {3} : Is used to check for 3 repetetions\n",
    "> {3, 5} : Is used to check for 3 - 5 repetetions \n",
    "12. What do the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "> \\\\d : Any numeric digit from 0-9.\n",
    "> \\\\w : Any letter, numeric digit or'_' character.\n",
    "> \\\\s : Any space, tab, or new line character.\n",
    "13. What do the \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "> \\\\D : Any character that is not a numeric digit from 0-9.\n",
    "> \\\\W : Any character that is not a letter, numeric digit or the underscore.\n",
    "> \\\\S : Any character that is not a space,tab or a new line.\n",
    "14. What is the difference between .* and .*??\n",
    "> .* : Greedy matched regex\n",
    "> .*? : Non-Greedy matched regex\n",
    "15. What is the character class syntax to match all numbers and lowercase letters?\n",
    "> \\[a-z0-9]\n",
    "16. How do you make a regular expression case-insensitive?\n",
    ">  Passing re.I or re.IGNORECASE as second argument to re.compile\n",
    "17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile()?\n",
    "> . Character normally matches any character except newline character. re.DOTAALL is passed as second argument to re.compile(), then the. will also ,match the newline characters.\n",
    "18. If numRegex = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '12 drummers, 11 pipers, five rings, 3 hens') return?\n",
    "> [\\'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens]\n",
    "19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the second argument to re.compile() allow you to do?\n",
    "> the re.VERBOSE argument allows you to add whitespace and comments to the string passed to re.compile()\n",
