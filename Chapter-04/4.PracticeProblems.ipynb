    "1. What is []?\n",
    "\n",
    "     [] - A list without any elements/empty list\n",
    "2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)\n",
    "\n",
    "      spam[2] = 'hello'\n",
    "      \n",
    "#### For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?\n",
    "\n",
    "       spam[3] = 'd'\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?\n",
    "\n",
    "       'd'\n",
    "5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?\n",
    "\n",
    "       ['a', 'b']\n",
    "#### For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?\n",
    " \n",
    "       1\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "       [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "       [3.14, 11, 'cat', True]\n",
    "9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Concatenation = +\n",
    "       Replication = -\n",
    "10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Append is used to add values to end of a list, but using insert we can add values anywhere in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "       remove(), pop()\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Indexing, Slicing, Can be COncatenated/replicated\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Lists are mutable, Lists are written with []\n",
    "       Tuples are immutable, tuples are defined with()\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?\n",
    "\n",
    "       tuple = (42, )\n",
    "15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Using tuple() and List()\n",
    "16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "       They are stored as references to  the computer\n",
    "17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "       copy.copy() : Can only copy the refereneces and cant copy lists inside a list\n",
    "       copy.deepcopy() : We can copy the lists inside a lists also \n"
