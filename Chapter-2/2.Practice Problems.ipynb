    "1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Two Boolean Data types are written as True and False\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the three Boolean operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "    and or and not are the threee types of boolean operators\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).\n",
    "\n",
    "  And Table\n",
    "  | Expression | Evaluates to |\n",
    "  | --- | --- |\n",
    "  | True and True | True|\n",
    "  | True and False | False |\n",
    "  | False and True | False | \n",
    "  | False and False | False | \n",
    " \n",
    "OR Table\n",
    "  | Expression | Evaluates to |\n",
    "  | --- | --- |\n",
    "  | True or True| True |\n",
    "  | True or False | True |\n",
    "  | False or True | True |\n",
    "  | False or Flase | False |\n",

    "\n",
    "    ==, !=, <, >, >=, <= \n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?\n",
    "\n",
    "     '=' : Assignment operator used to give value to a variable \n",
    "     '==' : Equal to operator is used to check if the given two expressions are equal or not\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Condition is used to check if a condition is satisfied or not in a given expression. These are used to decide when/how to execute based on the condition.\n",

    "\n",
    "     Total 3 Bocks\n",
    "     * Outer If: \n",

    "11. What is the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "\n",
    "     Break is used to exit from a loop, Continue is used to skip the rest of the loop and start the next iteration.\n",
