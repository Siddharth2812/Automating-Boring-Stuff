    "1. What is []?\n",

    "     [] - A list without any elements/empty list\n",
    "2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)\n",

    "       Concatenation = +\n",
    "       Replication = -\n",
    "10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?\n",
    "###\n",
    "       Append is used to add values to end of a list, but using insert we can add values anywhere in the list.\n",

    "11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?\n",
    "###\n",

    "13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?\n",
    "###\n",
    "       Lists are mutable, Lists are written with []\n",
    "       Tuples are immutable, tuples are defined with()\n",

    "       tuple = (42, )\n",
    "15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?\n",
    "###\n",
    "       Using tuple() and List()\n",
    "16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?\n",
    "###\n",
    "       They are stored as references to  the computer\n",
    "17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "###\n",
    "       copy.copy() : Can only copy the refereneces and cant copy lists inside a list\n",
    "       copy.deepcopy() : We can copy the lists inside a lists also \n"
